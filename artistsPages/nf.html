                    NF (stylized as ИF), real name Nathan Feuerstein (pronounced “fire-STINE”), is a rapper and
                    songwriter from the small town of Gladwin, Michigan. As a child, Nate’s parents went through a
                    divorce, where he would then live with his mother. Later on, Nate’s life started getting more
                    difficult whenever his mother’s boyfriend started physically abusing him. However, the most
                    traumatic event in Nate’s life was finding his mother dead from a drug overdose.

                    During the hard times of his life, Nate would fall back on music to escape from the world and
                    express himself freely by writing music and then recording it on his karaoke machine with
                    instrumentals playing in the background. In 2008, Nate participated in the Fine Arts Festival rap
                    competition.

                    In October 2017, she stepped out on her own with her debut single “Ready Yet” prior to releasing her
                    first EP sad girl on April 18, 2018. Her second EP loser was released on November 29, 2018.

                    In 2010, he released his first album, Moments, independently. The album got him a record deal with
                    Xist Music in 2012, with a new stage name, NF. Nate released two songs with Xist, and an EP was
                    announced, but never released because he decided to leave the label (however, most of these songs
                    can be found online). NF started working with fellow Michigan producer, Tommee Profitt, searching
                    for a new label.

                    After about two years, Nate and Tommee were spotted by Capitol Christian Music Group after hearing
                    their song “Wake Up”. In the summer of 2014, NF’s self-titled EP was released, including his debut
                    single “All I Have” and a re-recorded version of “Wake Up.” The following year was the release of
                    his debut album Mansion. The following year, Therapy Session was released and made it to #12 on the
                    Billboard 200 charts and was critically acclaimed for its passion and honesty behind the lyrics.

                    In 2017, NF moved from Capitol CMG to Capitol Records and announced his third album Perception. This
                    album was released on October 6 and is known as his mainstream debut. The project debuted at No. 1
                    on the iTunes overall charts and on the Billboard 200, beating out Tom Petty’s posthumous greatest
                    hits and Lil Pump’s debut album. His single “Let You Down” became a radio success shortly after and
                    is now a multi-platinum song.

                    On July 26, 2019, his fourth studio album, The Search was released. The project debuted at No.1 on
                    the Billboard 200 beating out Chance The Rapper’s debut studio album The Big Day.

                    On February 18, 2021, NF announced that his new project CLOUDS (THE MIXTAPE) would be released on
                    March 26, 2021, marking the first mixtape NF has ever released.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On February 16, 2023, NF announced that his fifth studio album, HOPE was released on April 7, 2023.
